***What is this?***
This bot creates "hierarchies" between rules.
These hierarchies define what

***What kind of hierarchies exist?***
Currently, only one kind of hierarchy exists: **Parent-child hierarchies.**
In these, a parent role and a child role are defined.
Whenever a child role is given, all of its parent roles are also given.
Whenever a parent role is removed, all of its child roles are also given.

***What can this bot actually do?***
This bot can store all the hierarchies you instruct it to.
It will also automatically enforce those hierarchies, when you add those hierarchies, and also when you remove or add roles in hierarchies.

***What commands can I give to the bot?***
There are currently 3 commands.

/hierarchyhelp --- DM this message.

/hierarchydisplay --- DM a message that describes all hierarchies on the server you sent this command on.

/hierarchycreate --- This command takes two roles, and then will create and store a hierarchy about them.

/hierarchyupdate --- This command is used to manually check and apply all hierarchies, since this isn't running reliably at the moment.

***The bot doesn't respond when I input a command!***
Could be from a number of reasons, but try the following fixes:
 - Make sure that the hierarchy helper role is above all roles that you want it to manage.

If none of the fixes work, please DM me:
