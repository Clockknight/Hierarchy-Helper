***What is this?***
This bot creates "hierarchies" between rules.
These hierarchies define what

***What kind of hierarchies exist?***
Currently, only one kind of hierarchy exists: **Parent-child hierarchies.**

It will also automatically enforce those hierarchies, when you add those hierarchies, and also when you remove or add roles in hierarchies.

***What commands can I give to the bot?***
There are currently 3 commands.

/hierarchyhelp --- DM this message.

/hierarchydisplay --- DM a message that describes all hierarchies on the server you sent this command on.

/hierarchycreate --- This command takes two roles, and then will create and store a hierarchy about them.
